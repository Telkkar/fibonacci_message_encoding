# fibonacci-message-encoding

## Idea
Using the Fibonacci sequence, a secret string is embedded in a listing
of words such that the secret string is not directly retreivable from
the listing.

Example: inmates passing secret messages between prisons use a code so
that the guards who read the messages are not able to see the secret
messages.

This entails that the sender and receiver place letters at certain
positions in the messages. This is effectively what we are doing, but
we will use the Fibonacci sequence as our determining position.

## Requirements
- Database of words [extremely large]
- Secret string to embed in a message
- An m\_o value for beginning the Fibonacci sequence
